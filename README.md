Abstract

This README.md is simply here to explain that I am learning how to use GitHub.  This is rather humorous in my opinion since I know how to program, but need to familiarize myself with github.  

9/17/2018

Finished everything except a release test.  Likely to include an executable jar file to allow people who don't know how to use command lines (or programming...) to use it.
